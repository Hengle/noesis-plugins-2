# noesis-plugins
Various format plugins for Noesis http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php#prjmp91

Place DLL files under plugins directory into your Noesis plugins directory.

Built using Visual Studio 2012, so Visual C++ 2012 x86 Redist is required.

Plugins:
* .4ds - LS3D engine (Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, Chameleon, Hidden & Dangerous 2, War of Wings) - import geometry with morphs and bones, but without proper bone weights (that part I never managed to get right).
